# Team Contract

## Communication
**Team Meetings** 

We will meet every Tuesday at around 7pm for 30 mins (either Zoom or Discord). We will also meet for 1 hour in-person on Saturday/Sunday afternoon. Additional meetings can be scheduled as necessary to get weekly/project requirements finished. We don’t plan to have someone taking meeting notes.

**Assistance** 

For communication, we will utilize a Discord group chat. Most communication will occur through this chat, but email/text will also be used. Since everyone has their own schedules, it is expected for members to respond within a business day.

**Respect** 

Every team member should respect that all ideas are open and welcome. Team members need to have civil discussions and show up to meetings on time to respect each other’s schedules. Additionally, everyone should use respectful language to not be mean to each other if we disagree with what other people are saying. 

## Collaboration

**Work Distribution** 

We plan to complete the weekly development log during scheduled meetings to make sure everyone contributes equally. For any small deliverables (e.g. Github Repo, unforseen small work, etc.), we’ll decide during a meeting who is responsible. 

We expect every group member to contribute equally in terms of total code contribution (not just writing the actual code). This includes properly documenting any code written, sharing progress with the group, and writing clean comments. This also includes completing the corresponding section in the written report and final presentation at the end of the semester. We’ll decide specific areas of responsibilities for code/algorithms once the project proposal is complete.



**Time Commitment** 

We expect every member to commit a minimum of 4 hours per week to the project, which includes meetings and work outside of class. Also, we don’t expect anyone to do work over Fall Break. 

If there’s a scheduled time conflict with a meeting, that person should let the group know at least 4 hours in advance to allow time for rescheduling. In case someone in the group takes on another major time commitment that interferes with the project, we’ll have a meeting to discuss shifting responsibilities.

**Conflict Resolution** 

In case of disagreements, we’ll discuss the issue as a group. If the disagreement isn’t resolved, we’ll go with a majority decision. If it’s serious enough that it can’t be resolved, we’ll contact course staff for guidance.

For instances where someone isn’t pulling their weight, we’ll discuss the issue as a group and put into place a plan to resolve the issue and get the project back on track. If the issue isn’t/can’t be resolved internally, we will again discuss it with course staff. These instances include: not completing tasks, being habitually late, disrupting teamwork, or other instances deemed to be in this category by majority decision.
