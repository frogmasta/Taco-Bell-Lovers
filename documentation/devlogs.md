# Development Log (Date: 10/28/2022 - 11/04/2022)

## Weekly Goals

Our goal for this week was to finish all the deliverables. This includes the Team Contract, Proposal, Github, and this Development Log. In the process of finishing the proposal, we had to brainstorm and decide on a project we all wanted to do. 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

This week was special because all the deliverables were completed in equal parts by the whole team. We all collaboratively worked on sections of the team contract, project proposal, and this development log. The GitHub repository was set-up by Eric Roth. 

## Problems Encountered 

One problem we encountered was deciding on a dataset and the algorithms we wanted to implement. We ended up agreeing on a dataset to use in the end, and the algorithms were decided on individual interest. 

## Plans for next week

Our plan for next week is to parse the input data and try to store it in an adjacency list. Also, we plan to do more research on our algorithms so we can better implement then in the coming weeks. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor

# Development Log (Date: 11/4/2022 -- 11/11/2022)

## Weekly Goals

Our main goal was to deeply research and understand the algorithms we are going to implement so we can start writing code next week. Another goal we had was to parse the input data and store it in a graph backed by an adjacency list.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

Eric set up the scaffolding of the project (e.x. make files, folder structure, file structure). Eric also wrote the code that parses the .csv file and stores it in a graph. Robert performed a code review to clean-up the code. Omeed and Shiva researched their respective algorithms to understand them on a deeper level and set up the project repository on their computers. Omeed and Shiva also wrote the development log for this week. 

## Problems Encountered 

One problem we encountered was finding time to meet and work on the project. We also needed to take some extra time to understand what exactly we were implementing and how to go about it. Specifically, we had discussions about how exactly we wanted to store our adjacency list. For example, like whether we should use a vector to store the edges or a linked list. 

## Plans for next week

Omeed is planning to find a way to store the graph as an adjacency matrix for the PageRank algorithm and write the bulk of the code. Robert plans on implementing everything for Dijkstra’s algorithm. Shiva is planning to wrap up research and begin programming the majority of the Strongly Connected Component algorithm. Eric’s plan for this week is to write test cases for the code that he wrote last week and work on data correction.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

Researching SCC algorithm and begun writing pseudocode for algorithm implementation on separate branch (Shiva)

Finished edge compression feature to be used for Djikstra's algorithm. Completed boilerplate code for Djikstra class (Robert)

Wrote boilerplate functions for PageRank algorithm and watched videos on how it is implemented (Omeed)

Refactored code written in the previous week for graph data structure, edges, and parsing (Eric)

## Problems Encountered 

## Plans for next week

Finish implementing Djikstra's algorithm and start writing unit tests.

# Development Log (Date: 11/18/2022 -- 12/02/2022)

## Weekly Goals

Our weekly goals were to finish the individual algorithms and write test cases for them. We also wanted to write test cases for the data parsing/correction.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

Shiva completed his Strongly Connected Components Algorithm and the unit tests along with it. Omeed is debugging his PageRank algorithm. Eric wrote test cases for data parsing/correction. Robert did some bug fixes on his implementation of Djikstra’s algorithm and wrote test cases.  

## Problems Encountered 

Omeed ran into some unforeseen difficulties when implementing his PageRank solution. It will take an extra week for him to finish his algorithm.

## Plans for next week

Eric plans to write test cases for the bfs traversal. Omeed plans to finish his PageRank algorithm and write test cases. Shiva and Robert plan to help as needed (e.x. cleaning up main.cpp).
